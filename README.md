#Restricted Boltzmann machine
Invented by Geoff Hinton, RMBis an algorithm useful for dimensionality reduction, classification, regression they are commony used in machine learning
as autoencoders because their abilty to reconstruct data.

For a learning problem, the Boltzmann machine is shown a set of binary data vectors and it must learn to generate these vectors with high probability.
To do this, it must find weights on the connections so that, relative to other possible binary vectors, the data vectors have low values of the cost function. 


##Other purposes. 
RBMs are shallow, two-layer neural nets that constitute the building blocks of deep-belief networks.
